## Component Size

### The width of the side navigation can be defined based on the length of the text labels in the actual business context. Common widths include 200PX, 220PX, 240PX, and 260PX.

## Usage Principles

### Keep the menu flat: A flat hierarchy can expose more functions to users at first glance, thereby improving the efficiency of information access and reducing operation steps\n Control the number of menu items: According to Miller's Law, the average person can keep 5-9 items in their working memory. Too many options can increase the user's selection time, and an excessive number of menu items can overwhelm and intimidate users.

## Copywriting Guide

### Text labels should clearly summarize the content of the module, using concise nouns such as "Home", "Discover", "Wallet", etc.

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### Navigation menus are suitable for system-level function navigation and should not be used for organizing content and functionalities of submodules. Information navigation for submodules should use tab components.
