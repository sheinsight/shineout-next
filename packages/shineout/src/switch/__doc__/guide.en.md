## When to use

When you need to represent the state of a switch or toggle between only two states; when you need instant application of changes.

## Component pairing

![When there is a risk associated with opening or closing the switch, a dialog box can be used for secondary confirmation when used in conjunction with a modal.](01)

## Recommended/Not recommended examples

![Switch text should be accurate and concise, expressing only the content that is being controlled, avoiding logical phrases or content that contradicts the action of the switch.](02)
