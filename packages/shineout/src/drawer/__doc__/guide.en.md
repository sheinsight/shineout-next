## When to use

When you need an additional panel to supplement the content of the page\nwhen you need to insert temporary operation tasks in the current task flow.

## Related to page layout

![Overall interface layout: The drawer appears across the entire page\nPartial area layout: The drawer only appears in the current operation area, without covering the entire page](01)

## Recommended/Cautious examples

![1. The maximum width of the drawer is recommended not to exceed 80% of the screen width, because the original intention of the drawer design is to provide a quick access channel, not to replace the entire page](01)

![2. Avoid designing too many nested levels, usually not more than two levels. Too many levels will make users spend more time looking for the information they need, increase user burden, and also affect user experience](02)
