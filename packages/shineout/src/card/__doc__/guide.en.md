## When to use

When different types of data need to be combined and displayed in the same area\nWhen more data or operations are needed to supplement the picture\nWhen there is interactive information content and the length needs to be changed within a spatial layout

## Use components together

![1. Cards are used in conjunction with paging. When there are too many cards and a certain number needs to be displayed on each page, users can turn pages to find pictures](01)

![2. Cards are used in conjunction with step-by-step loading. When there are a large number of cards and need to be updated in real time, or waterfall flow display is required, user operations can be reduced and an immersive experience can be provided](02)

![3. Cards are used in conjunction with the search box. When there are a large number of cards, users can accurately search and quickly find the corresponding card](03)

## Recommended/use with caution examples

![When the data format is consistent and the information type is simple, it is recommended to use list presentation instead of cards to avoid increasing the complexity of the page](04)
