          Joy in living comes from having fine emotions, trusting them, giving them the freedom of a
          bird in the open. Joy in living can never be assumed as a pose, or put on from the outside
          as a mask. People who have this joy do not need to talk about it; they radiate it. They
          just live out their joy and let it splash its sunlight and glow into other lives as
          naturally as bird sings.
