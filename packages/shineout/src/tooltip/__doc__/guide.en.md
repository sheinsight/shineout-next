## When to use

No need for permanent display, when the mouse needs to be moved in to display text explanations

## Common usage of components

![Used in forms or in advanced searches, usually after the field title](01)

![Prompts with less text content use a black text arrow prompt box by default. The scene has a hover display of helpful question icons and a hover display of truncated text](02)

## Recommended/use with caution examples

![Text prompt information should not be too much, generally no more than three lines. When there is a lot of prompt content, it is more suitable to use the bubble component](03)
